# Motivation 
[WIYO](https://wiyo-beta.herokuapp.com/users/sign_in) is a platform that matches entrepreneurs, business school alumni, professional coaches, developers, digital nomads and other groups who are interested in getting connected or discussing business opportunities in a more convenient and engaging way. They  use big data tools to analyze profiles of professionals to suggest the best matches for cooperation, knowledge sharing and business networking. Our  Challenge 7 team was set to solve WaiDATATHON Challenge  where we obtained a dataset and  a recommender system was  built to match a user dataset of job profiles of professionals and international businesses to a dataset of local networks where they are traveling.

# Dataset :  We built the dataset based on LinkedIn dataset from Kaggle.
